# 概述
airbnb's Superset 是基于Python的开发的开源数据分析平台，本文对它的使用做简要说明。

# 安装

使用以下命令，在CentOS7平台上安装Superset。在此之前，你需要先安装好Python。
```
sudo yum upgrade python-setuptools
sudo yum install gcc libffi-devel python-devel python-pip
python-wheel openssl-devel libsasl2-devel openldap-devel
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv. ./venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade setuptools pip
pip install mysqlclient 
pip install pyhive
pip install superset
fabmanager create-admin --app superset

superset db upgrade
superset load_examples
superset init
superset runserver -p 8088
```

Browse to http://yourservername:8088/ and start running querys, building charts and reports. It does a lot of things that commercial reporting tools do, but fully open source. Superset + Zeppelin + CLI + ODBC + JDBC give me all the access to my Hadoop, Druid, SparkSQL and MariaDB data that I need.



This is admin with the password you set in the fabmanager create admin.



Browsing tables is easy in the web based platform.



The results of running a query which shows the intellisense that suggests table names for you.



This was a built-in example report that shows you how powerful and professional reports you can build with this tool.

The SQL Lab is a great place to try out queries and examine data.



SQL Lab lets you run queries and explore the data. You get quick access to your previous queries and run status.



This is a simple report that was autogenerated for me by picking a query on one table.



This is your home page that will show you dashboards you have built and recent activity. A very nice github style interface.
